  "(Forward-secure anamorphic broadcast with public updates). Under k-LWE there exists an FS-AB for a polynomial number of epochs τ=1,…,T where senders publish a short public update token U_τ enabling all honest users to update their double keys non-interactively. For any adversary that learns sk and any set of compromised double keys at epoch τ, hidden messages from epochs <τ remain semantically hidden and DI/AnonCh continue to hold across epochs; moreover the distribution of ciphertexts (conditioned on pk and sk) is independent of τ.",
  "(Multi-sender composability without coordination). There is an LWE-based AB that supports arbitrarily many independent senders who share only \(\mathsf{pk}\) (and the public update tokens in FS-AB), with no coordination among senders: concurrent anamorphic ciphertexts targeting overlapping or equal channels remain jointly DI and AnonCh, and do not create cross-ciphertext linkability or format deviations from Dual Regev.",
  "(Chosen-randomness DI). There exists an LWE-based AB achieving CR-DI: DI holds even if the dictator adaptively dictates both the primary message and the encryption coins \(r\) used by \(\mathsf{Enc}_{\mathsf{pk}}\) (subject only to \(r\) being in the algorithm’s valid domain so correctness is preserved). The resulting ciphertexts still ct-format match Dual Regev and are indistinguishable from ordinary ones under the dictated coins.",
  "(Generic FS-AB from AnonMCBE + SUE/UE). If there exists (i) an AnonMCBE whose ciphertexts are ct-format indistinguishable from Dual Regev and (ii) a ciphertext-independent self/updatable-encryption (SUE/UE) with public tokens, then there is a black-box composition that yields an FS-AB with: public updates of size \(O(\lambda)\), epoch-independent ciphertext distribution equal to Dual Regev, and preservation of DI/AnonCh over all epochs.",
  "(t‑of‑n Multi‑Authority Public Updates). Under k‑LWE there exists an FS‑AB where each epoch token U_τ is a homomorphic aggregation U_τ=Agg(U_{τ,1},…,U_{τ,n}) so that any t of the n public sub‑tokens suffice to update double keys, fewer reveal nothing; the distribution of each U_{τ,i} (and of U_τ) is independent of τ, ℓ, and {S_i}, and ciphertexts remain ≡_c DR(pk,m;·) with DI/AnonCh across epochs.",
  "(FS‑AB ⇒ UE/UPKE). Any FS‑AB with public tokens and epoch‑independent ciphertext distribution that ct‑format matches Dual Regev implies (in a black‑box way) a ciphertext‑independent public‑token UE/UPKE with O(λ)‑size updates and IND‑CPA security: instantiate a single‑recipient AB with k=2 and treat each epoch’s per‑channel hidden payload as the UE key‑evolution material; correctness and privacy of UE follow from AB correctness and DI across epochs.",
  "(Linearly aggregatable anamorphic broadcast) There exists an AB over message space \mathbb{Z}_q^d in which, for any set of independently produced ciphertexts C_1,\dots,C_t targeting the same hidden channel, any legitimate receiver can non-interactively derive \sum_{j=1}^t \alpha_j m^{(j)} for public coefficients \alpha_j\in\mathbb{Z}_q, without enabling recovery of individual m^{(j)} beyond what linear algebra implies; DI/AnonCh are preserved and each C_j is \equiv_c\,\mathrm{DR}.",
  "(Dynamic public enrollment for FS-AB) Under k-\mathsf{LWE}, there is an FS-AB that supports on-the-fly user enrollment (and late-arriving devices) with no change to \mathsf{pk} and no re-issuance to existing users: a new user i obtains \mathsf{dsk}_i via a non-interactive registration using only public parameters and an authority DPRF response; thereafter, standard public update tokens (size O(\lambda)) suffice for i to participate in all future epochs. The joint distributions of ciphertexts and update tokens remain independent of the evolving user set and of \tau.",
  "(Intra-channel threshold decryption) Under k-\mathsf{LWE}, there exists an AB supporting per-channel thresholds: for each channel S_i with threshold u_i, any u_i holders of \{\mathsf{dsk}_j:j\in S_i\} can jointly recover m_i from a single ciphertext C, while any coalition of size <u_i (even augmented with all \mathsf{sk} and all other double keys) learns nothing about m_i; DI/CR-DI/AnonCh continue to hold and C \equiv_c\,\mathrm{DR}.",
  "(KDM-secure hidden channels for affine/low-degree \mathcal{F}). Under k-\mathsf{(R)MLWE} there is an AB where, for each hidden channel i, the covert payload m_i may be any f_i(\mathsf{dsk}_{S_i},\mathsf{aux}) for f_i in a fixed \mathcal{F} of affine (or degree-2) functions over \mathbb{Z}_q with bounded output dimension; semantic security for (m_i)_i and DI/AnonCh still hold (in the ROM), and C\equiv_c\mathrm{DR}.",
  "(Cross-epoch linear aggregation). If an FS-AB has epoch-independent ciphertext distribution (as in the seed), then there exists a black-box augmentation (under k-\mathsf{LWE}) enabling any legitimate receiver to non-interactively compute \sum_{j}\alpha_j m^{(j)} from ciphertexts targeting the same hidden channel across arbitrary epochs, for public coefficients \alpha_j\in\mathbb{Z}_q, without leaking the individual m^{(j)} beyond linear implications; DI/AnonCh persist.",
  "{(Publicly re-randomizable multi-authority updates). Extending t-of-n multi-authority public updates, under k-LWE there is an FS-AB in which each U_{τ,i} and the aggregated U_τ admit public re-randomization ReRand producing tokens indistinguishable from fresh ones for the same epoch, while still allowing any t authorities’ subtokens to aggregate. The distributions of {U_{τ,i}}, U_τ, and their re-randomizations are independent of τ and ℓ; AB ciphertexts remain ≡_cDR with DI/AnonCh.}",
  "{(Identity-indexed FS-AB with dynamic enrollment). Under k-(R)MLWE there exists an FS-AB where user identities ID∈{0,1}^* act as public indices: any user can non-interactively obtain a double key dsk_{ID} via a DPRF-based registration using only public parameters and a single authority response, after which standard public updates suffice. Ciphertexts and updates are independent of the evolving ID set and of τ and remain ≡_cDR; DI/AnonCh and forward security hold.}",
  "(Multi‑shot threshold assembly across ciphertexts). Under k‑LWE there exists an AB supporting t‑out‑of‑T multi‑shot covert delivery: a sender can encode a single covert payload \(m\) across \(T\) independent ciphertexts so that any authorized receiver set possessing the requisite channel keys and any \(t\) of the ciphertexts can recover \(m\); any coalition with fewer than \(t\) ciphertexts (even with all \(\mathsf{sk}\) and unrelated \(\mathsf{dsk}\)s) learns nothing beyond linear implications; DI/AnonCh and DR‑format hold per ciphertext.",
  "(Zero‑knowledge well‑formedness proofs without format change). Under k‑LWE there exists an AB admitting publicly verifiable NIZKs that a given token \(U_\tau\) is a correct (possibly multi‑authority) aggregate update and that a ciphertext \(C\in\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{DR}}(\mathsf{pk},\cdot)\), all with witness‑indistinguishable statements that do not alter the ciphertext distribution; DI/AnonCh persist.",
  "(Cross‑epoch KDM for covert payloads with DR‑format). Under k‑(R)MLWE in the ROM (or QROM), there exists an FS‑AB whose covert payload for channel \(i\) at epoch \(\tau\) may be any \(f_{i,\tau}(\{\mathsf{dsk}_u\}_{u\in S_i},\mathrm{aux}_\tau)\) from a fixed family of bounded‑degree (affine/low‑degree) functions over \(\mathbb{Z}_q\), with semantic security for the joint vector of covert payloads across all epochs and DI/AnonCh preserved; ciphertexts remain epoch‑independent and \(\equiv_c\) Dual‑Regev.",
  "(AB with LSSS per‑channel access). Under k‑LWE there exists an anamorphic broadcast (AB) whose per‑channel access policy is any monotone LSSS (M_i,ρ_i) over ℤ_q: for channel i, any coalition whose LSSS rows reconstruct the target vector can jointly recover m_i from a single ciphertext C, while any unauthorized coalition (even given sk and all other double keys) learns nothing about m_i; DI/CR‑DI/AnonCh hold and C ≡_c DR(pk,·;·).",
  "{(\textbf{Insider channel anonymity}).\; Under\; k\text{-}\mathsf{LWE}\; there exists an AB for which I-AnonCh holds: for any coalition that holds double keys for channels \{S_j\}_{j\in J} disjoint from target channel S_i, a ciphertext carrying a payload for S_i is indistinguishable from one carrying no payload for S_i (and vice versa), even given all \mathsf{sk} and public tokens; ciphertexts remain DR-format and multi-sender composability holds.}",
  "{(\textbf{Correlated-coins multi-sender CR-DI}).\; Under\; k\text{-}\mathsf{LWE}\; there exists an AB such that for any polynomial number t of concurrent encryptions (possibly by independent senders) and any dictator that adaptively dictates valid coins r^{(1)},\dots,r^{(t)} subject to arbitrary efficiently describable linear constraints over \mathbb{Z}_q across the t encryptions, the joint ciphertext distribution remains DR-format and jointly DI/AnonCh; i.e., (C^{(1)},\dots,C^{(t)}) \equiv_c (\mathrm{DR}(\mathsf{pk},\cdot; r^{(1)}),\dots,\mathrm{DR}(\mathsf{pk},\cdot; r^{(t)})), and multi-sender composability still holds.}",

Tokens are publicly re-randomizable and compose along paths (U_{\tau\to\tau''}=\mathrm{Agg}(U_{\tau\to\tau'},U_{\tau'\to\tau''})); ciphertext distributions remain epoch-independent and DR-format; DI/AnonCh and forward security hold.}",
  "(PCS‑AB from UE with PCS). Assume there exists a ciphertext‑independent UE with public tokens of size O(\lambda), epoch‑independent ciphertext distribution, and post‑compromise security (PCS) in the (Q)ROM under k‑(R)MLWE. Then there exists an AB with public updates achieving PCS‑AB: after any total compromise at epoch \tau_\star, covert payloads in all epochs \ge \tau_\star+\Delta regain semantic security and DI/AnonCh for some \Delta=\mathrm{poly}(\lambda); ciphertexts remain epoch‑independent and C \equiv_c \mathrm{DR}(\mathsf{pk},\cdot;\cdot).",
  "(Time‑locked AB with public updates). Under k‑LWE there exists an FS‑AB supporting time‑lock release: for any target channel i and chosen \tau_{\mathrm{rel}}, a sender can produce a DR‑format ciphertext C that is correct and decryptable for i if and only if the receiver’s double key has applied all public tokens through epoch \tau_{\mathrm{rel}}; prior to that, even coalitions holding all \mathsf{sk} and all dsk’s for i learn nothing about m_i beyond linear implications; DI/AnonCh persist across epochs.",
  "(Hidden‑threshold AB). Under k‑LWE there exists an AB with intra‑channel threshold decryption where each threshold u_i is hidden: any coalition of size <u_i within S_i (even equipped with all other double keys and \mathsf{sk}) learns nothing about m_i and also cannot distinguish whether the true threshold is u_i or u'_i in a specified range; authorized coalitions of size \ge u_i decrypt from a single DR‑format ciphertext; DI/CR‑DI/AnonCh continue to hold.",
  "(UE/UPKE with epoch/receiver obliviousness from I‑AnonCh AB). If an FS‑AB provides I‑AnonCh, Steg‑U, and epoch‑independent DR‑format ciphertexts, then there is a black‑box implication to a ciphertext‑independent UE/UPKE whose update tokens and ciphertexts are indistinguishable from ordinary DR traffic and hide both the target epoch and whether any update took place (epoch‑obliviousness), while achieving IND‑CPA (and PCS when the source AB has PCS‑AB).",
  "Under $k$-\mathsf{LWE}, there exists an anamorphic broadcast scheme realizing any per-channel monotone LSSS $(M_i,\rho_i)$ with policy-hiding: for any two channels whose LSSS have the same size parameters, the joint distributions of ciphertexts and public tokens are computationally indistinguishable even given $(\mathsf{pk},\mathsf{sk})$ and all double keys for any coalition that is simultaneously unauthorized for both policies. Only correctness leakage is permitted (authorized coalitions can recover; coalitions unauthorized for a given policy learn nothing). Ciphertexts remain in Dual-Regev format and multi-sender composability holds.",
  "If there exists an FS‑AB over $k$‑\mathsf{LWE} whose ciphertexts are epoch‑independent and Dual‑Regev‑format, that (i) supports publicly verifiable NIZK well‑formedness proofs for ciphertexts without changing the ciphertext core’s distribution, and (ii) enjoys CCA‑robust DI with chosen randomness (CR‑DI), then there is a black‑box construction of a ciphertext‑independent public‑token UPKE achieving IND‑CCA1 security in the QROM, with $O(\lambda)$‑size updates, via a two‑recipient instantiation that treats per‑epoch covert payloads as key‑evolution material and uses the NIZKs to enforce decryption validity without changing ciphertext format.",
  "Generalized statement. Let AB be any encryption scheme whose ciphertext, for every fixed valid coins string r (possibly adversarially and adaptively chosen), is computationally indistinguishable from Dual-Regev encryption with the same coins and message, i.e., for all (pk,m,ch,r), Enc^{AB}_{pk}(m,ch; r) ≡_c DR(pk,m; r). Then for any polynomial t and any dictator who adaptively dictates valid coins (possibly arbitrarily correlated across ciphertexts), the joint ciphertext distribution over t encryptions is computationally indistinguishable from DR-format and the two branches (DI and channel anonymity) are jointly indistinguishable, even under arbitrary concurrent multi-sender executions.

  "Single-ciphertext LSSS extraction. Assuming k-LWE and a prime modulus q, there exists an AB over message space \(\mathbb{Z}_q^d\) supporting monotone LSSS access for hidden linear functionals: each ciphertext \(C\) encodes a vector \(\mathbf{m}\) and a policy \((M,\rho)\) such that any receiver holding double keys for an authorized set \(S\) (i.e., there exists \(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\) supported on \(\rho^{-1}(S)\) with \(\boldsymbol{\gamma}^\top M=\mathbf{1}^\top\)) can locally compute any public linear form \(\langle \boldsymbol{\alpha}, \mathbf{m} \rangle\), while unauthorized sets learn nothing about \(\mathbf{m}\) beyond what their rows \(M_T\) alone imply.
