(Eventual convexity at full stability range.) Let f be convex and L-smooth with X_\star\ne\varnothing. For any fixed \eta\in(0,\tfrac{2}{L}), there exists N=N(f,x_0,\eta)<\infty such that the optimization curve becomes convex after N, i.e., \Delta_n\downarrow for all n\ge N. Moreover, if f is \mu-strongly convex, one can choose N\le C\,\kappa\,\log\kappa with a universal constant C.
