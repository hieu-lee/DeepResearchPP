Fix L>0. For the convex L-smooth quadratic f(x)=\tfrac{L}{2}\|x\|^2, any initialization x_0\ne 0, and any stepsize \eta\in(1/L,2/L), let the gradient-descent iterates be x_{n+1}=x_n-\eta\nabla f(x_n), and define the quadratic model \(Q_n(y)=f(x_n)+\langle\nabla f(x_n),y-x_n\rangle+\tfrac{1}{2\eta}\|y-x_n\|^2\) and the model gaps \(\delta_n:=Q_n(x_{n+1})-f(x_{n+1})\). Then {\delta_n} is strictly increasing (hence not nonincreasing), and in fact the sequence n\mapsto\delta_n is strictly concave (i.e., \(\delta_{n+2}-2\delta_{n+1}+\delta_n<0\)), so it is not convex.
