A stronger counterexample holds in one dimension: let $f(x)=\tfrac12 x^2$, which is convex and $1$-smooth. Then for any fixed stepsize $\eta\in[\tfrac32,2)$ and any nonzero initialization $x_0$, the gradient-descent iterates $x_{n+1}=x_n-\eta\nabla f(x_n)$ with averages $\bar x_n=\tfrac1{n+1}\sum_{k=0}^n x_k$ produce a sequence $n\mapsto f(\bar x_n)$ that is not convex. Moreover, the gradient norms satisfy $\|g_n\|=\|\nabla f(x_n)\|>0$ and are strictly decreasing to $0$.
