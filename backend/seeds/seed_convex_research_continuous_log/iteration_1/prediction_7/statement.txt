(Accelerated threshold for convex optimization curve under local quadraticity.) Suppose f is convex, L-smooth, and \mu-strongly convex in a neighborhood of X_\star with \nabla^2 f(x)\preceq L I everywhere and \nabla^2 f(x)\succeq \mu I for all x with f(x)-f_\star\le \varepsilon. Then for any \eta\in\big(0,\tfrac{2}{L}\big), there exists N=O\!\left(\kappa\log\tfrac{f(x_0)-f_\star}{\varepsilon}\right) such that the optimization curve is convex for all n\ge N.
