(Safeguarded Polyak step with convex curve.) Consider the safeguarded Polyak step-size \eta_n=\min\Big\{\tfrac{f_n-f_\star}{\|g_n\|^2},\,\tfrac{2}{L}\Big\}. For convex L-smooth f with known f_\star, the resulting GD has a convex optimization curve for all n and obeys f_n-f_\star\le \frac{C L\|x_0-x_\star\|^2}{n+1} with a universal C, while enjoying linear rate when f is \mu-strongly convex.
