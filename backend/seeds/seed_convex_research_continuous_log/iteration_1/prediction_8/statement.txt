(Convexity of the composite curve for proximal regularization.) Let f be convex L-smooth and let \phi be a proper closed convex function with \operatorname{prox}_{\lambda \phi} nonexpansive. For composite updates x_{n+1}=\operatorname{prox}_{\lambda\phi}(x_n-\eta \nabla f(x_n)) with \eta\in(0,\tfrac{2}{L}] and any \lambda>0, the sequence n\mapsto f(x_n)+\phi(x_n) has nonincreasing decrements for all \eta\le \tfrac{7}{4L}. Moreover, if \phi is \alpha-strongly convex and f is \mu-strongly convex, then for all \eta\in(0,\tfrac{2}{L}) the composite curve is eventually convex after O((\mu+\alpha)^{-1}L\,\log\kappa) steps.
