Stronger nonexistence claim. Fix any L>0 and consider the one-dimensional convex L-smooth quadratic f(x)=\tfrac{L}{2}x^2. For any nonzero initialization x_0 and any legitimate step \eta_0\in(0,\tfrac{2}{L}] with \alpha_0:=L\eta_0\in\bigl(1-\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\,1+\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\bigr), the feasibility set defining
$$\widehat\eta_1:=\sup\{\eta\in(0,\tfrac{2}{L}]:\ f(x_1)-f(x_2(\eta))\ge f(x_0)-f(x_1)\},\quad x_2(\eta)=x_1-\eta g_1,$$
is empty (hence \widehat\eta_1 does not exist). Equivalently, for this f and any x_0\ne 0, the set is empty if and only if \alpha_0\in\bigl(1-\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\,1+\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\bigr). In particular, choosing \alpha_0=\tfrac{3}{2} (i.e., \eta_0=\tfrac{3}{2L}) makes the set empty. Consequently, the prescription \eta_n\equiv\widehat\eta_n is not, in general, well-defined and therefore need not produce a convex optimization curve nor match the worst-case rate of the best fixed step size chosen in hindsight.
