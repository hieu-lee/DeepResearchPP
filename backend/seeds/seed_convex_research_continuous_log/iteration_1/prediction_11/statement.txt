(Two-step descent smoothing yields convexity beyond 7/(4L).) For convex L-smooth f and \eta\in(\tfrac{7}{4L},\tfrac{2}{L}), define the smoothed values s_n:=\tfrac{1}{2}(f_n+f_{n+1}). Then the smoothed optimization curve n\mapsto s_n is convex for all n. If f is \mu-strongly convex, the same holds for any fixed \eta\in(0,\tfrac{2}{L}).
