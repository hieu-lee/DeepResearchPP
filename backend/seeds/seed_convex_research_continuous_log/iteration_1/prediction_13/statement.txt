(Spectral separation implies global convexity up to 2/L for quadratics.) For quadratic f(x)=\tfrac{1}{2}x^\top H x+b^\top x with H\succeq 0, if the eigenvalues of H belong to a union of two intervals [\mu,\alpha]\cup[\beta,L] with \alpha/\beta\le c_0 for a universal constant c_0<1, then for any \eta\in(0,\tfrac{2}{L}) the optimization curve of GD is convex for all x_0. In particular, all diagonal quadratics with at most two distinct eigenvalues satisfy global convexity for all \eta\in(0,\tfrac{2}{L}).
