Let f(x)=\tfrac12 x^\top H x+b^\top x with H\succeq 0. For any constant stepsize \eta\ge 0 satisfying 2I-\eta H\succeq 0 (equivalently, 0\le \eta\le 2/\lambda_{\max}(H)), the sequence k\mapsto f(x_k) generated by gradient descent x_{k+1}=x_k-\eta\nabla f(x_k) is nonincreasing and convex for every initialization x_0.
