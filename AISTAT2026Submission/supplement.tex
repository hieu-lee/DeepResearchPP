\section{Overview}
This supplement contains additional details and extended proofs supporting the main results. It is single-column per AISTATS guidance.

\section{Additional Proof Details}
Due to space limits, the main paper presents proof sketches. Full derivations follow the classic overlap--residual coupling arguments and Taylor/MGF bounds as outlined there. We will include full line-by-line proofs in the extended version.
