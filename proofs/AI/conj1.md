**Claim.** The “Conjecture (Lottery Ticket Hypothesis; general form)” as stated is not a mathematically well-posed proposition and therefore cannot be proved or disproved in its present form.

**Proof.** The statement reads: “With high probability over initialization $\theta_0$, there exists a sparse mask $m$ with $\|m\|_0=o(P)$ that is a winning ticket for $(\mathcal A,\mathcal D,T)$ on standard vision/NLP tasks.” We show the current phrasing prevents a precise, truth-apt mathematical claim.

1) Ill-defined asymptotic. The requirement $\|m\|_0=o(P)$ is an asymptotic assertion that only has meaning along a specified sequence indexed by the parameter count $P\to\infty$. Formally, $\|m\|_0=o(P)$ means that for a sequence of models $(f_{\theta^{(P)}})$ (with architectures, depth/width, etc., scaling with $P$) and masks $m^{(P)}$, one has $\lim_{P\to\infty}\|m^{(P)}\|_0/P=0$. The conjecture does not specify any asymptotic family (how the architecture and its initialization law scale with $P$, nor whether $\mathcal D$ may vary across $P$). For a single fixed model size, $o(P)$ has no content. Thus, absent an explicit asymptotic regime, the clause $\|m\|_0=o(P)$ is undefined.

2) Undefined task class. The phrase “on standard vision/NLP tasks” does not designate a mathematically specified family of distributions or datasets. Without an explicit domain (e.g., a set $\mathfrak T$ of data-generating distributions on $(\mathcal X,\mathcal Y)$ or a fixed finite collection of benchmarks), the universal quantification “on standard tasks” lacks semantics; different plausible formalizations yield non-equivalent statements.

3) Probability qualifier contingent on an unstated asymptotic family. Given (1), an asymptotic high-probability statement must be formalized via a sequence: for each $P$, specify an initialization distribution $\Pi_P$ on $\theta_0^{(P)}$ and an event $E_P$ (here, “there exists a mask $m^{(P)}$ with $\|m^{(P)}\|_0=o(P)$ that is a winning ticket for $(\mathcal A,\mathcal D,T)$ at size $P$”), and require $\Pi_P(E_P)\to1$ as $P\to\infty$. This formalization is impossible to instantiate before fixing the same missing asymptotic specification from (1): the architecture sequence and corresponding initialization laws $\{\Pi_P\}$. Hence, in the presence of $o(P)$, the qualifier “with high probability” has no determinate referent in its current form.

4) Training budget is not a source of ambiguity. By definition of “winning ticket,” $(\mathcal A,\mathcal D,T)$ is fixed; in particular, $T$ is independent of $P$ in the conjecture as stated. Our conclusion of ill-posedness relies solely on (1)–(3), not on any ambiguity about $T$.

Because items (1)–(2) leave essential quantifiers and domains unspecified, and item (3) cannot even be instantiated without the missing asymptotic family from (1), the conjecture as written does not constitute a well-posed mathematical statement. It is therefore neither true nor false in the formal sense until the asymptotic model family, task class, and the initialization laws across sizes are specified. ∎
