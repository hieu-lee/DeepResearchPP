A set G’ of planar graphs on the same number n of vertices is called simultaneously embeddable if there exists a set P of n points in the plane such that every graph G ∈ G’ admits a (crossing-free) straight-line embedding with vertices placed at points of P. A conflict collection is a set of planar graphs of the same order with no simultaneous embedding. Determine whether there exists a conflict collection of size 2.
