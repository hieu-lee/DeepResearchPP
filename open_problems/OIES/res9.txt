\textbf{Conjecture (Fried's closed forms refining A248982).}\ \text{Let }(a_n)_{n\ge1}\text{ be the lexicographically least sequence of pairwise distinct positive integers such that the average of any initial segment is a Fibonacci number }F_k.\ \text{Then there exist explicit closed-form expressions for }a_n\text{ on each interval where the running average equals }F_k\ (\text{as suggested in the paper}).
