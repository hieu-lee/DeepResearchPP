\begin{definition}
Let \mathbb{N} denote the set of positive integers. Let \varphi(n) be Euler's totient function and let \gcd(\cdot,\cdot) be the greatest common divisor.
A positive integer m is called \emph{cyclic} if and only if \gcd\!\bigl(m,\varphi(m)\bigr)=1. Define the set of cyclic integers
\[\mathcal{C}:=\{m\in\mathbb{N}: \gcd(m,\varphi(m))=1\},\]
and let \(c_1<c_2<\cdots\) be the increasing enumeration of \(\mathcal{C}\).
Let \(\mathcal{P}\) be the set of prime numbers and let \(p_1<p_2<\cdots\) be its increasing enumeration. Let \(\gamma\) denote the Euler--Mascheroni constant.
For a set S, write \(\#S\) for its cardinality.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{Sophie Germain cyclic} is a cyclic integer \(c\in\mathcal{C}\) such that \(2c+1\in\mathcal{C}\). Let the increasing sequence of SG cyclics be \(\sigma_1<\sigma_2<\cdots\).
Define the counting function of SG cyclics by \(C_{\mathrm{SG}}(x):=\#\{\,\sigma\le x : \sigma\text{ is an SG cyclic}\,\}\).
\end{definition}

\textbf{Conjecture 37 (SG cyclics modulo 3).}
As the number of SG cyclics grows, the limiting fractions congruent to 1 and 3 mod 3 are equal.
