# What needs work (blocking/near-blocking)

These are the places I’d want clarified before recommending acceptance.

1. **Legendre analog (between consecutive squares): uniformity + union-of-intervals BT**

* You use a **linear Selberg sieve** with (H\asymp x^{1/2}), (z=x^{1/4}(\log x)^{-6}), then remove squarefulls and divisibility obstructions via BT (including a **weighted BT over finite unions**). The structure is sound, but please:

  * Give a **precise citation** for the *weighted BT for unions* and the constant used there, and explicitly state the *range of parameters* (size of the union, minimal moduli, and lower endpoint (z)). You already paraphrase this tool in “Uniform tools,” but a theorem-level pointer would help a referee check constants. 
  * Make the **uniformity** of the Pollack expansion / de Haan Π-variation step completely explicit in the “consecutive squares” asymptotic: your argument compares (x) and (\lambda x) (fixed (\lambda)), then specializes to (x=n^2), (\lambda=1+O(1/n)). Spell out the bound that controls replacing (\log_3(n^2)) with (\log_3 n) (you mention the (O(1/\log_2 n)) drift—state it cleanly and box the auxiliary function used). This is largely there, but a short lemma with hypotheses would de-risk the step.

2. **Twin cyclics between cubes (dim-2 sieve level vs. error terms)**

* The β-sieve lower bound with level (D\le z^u) and your choice (z=(\log X)^A) looks fine; however the subtraction of exceptions (squarefulls and “internal divisibility” (p\mid(q-1))) needs **clear domination** by the main term for a single concrete (A). You do say “choose (A) large,” but give a **worked inequality** showing the exact (A) (and (u)) that make the two error families (o\big(H'/(\log\log X)^2\big)). That would turn a plausible argument into a bulletproof one. 

3. **SG cyclics (CRT + roughness): density lower bound and BT steps**

* The CRT construction for simultaneous roughness of (n) and (2n+1) is nice; you then prune squarefulls and internal (p\mid(q-1)) events via BT/partial summation. Please **aggregate all parameter constraints** (the (y=\exp\sqrt{\log\log x}) choice, where BT is invoked, and the final density (\gg x/\log\log x)) into one lemma with an explicit inequality chain. This is mostly present but buried across steps; a consolidated statement will aid checking.  

4. **Fibonacci averages section (A248982):**

* The abstract and summary advertise **closed forms for all (n)** and **Fried’s Conjecture 2** (disjointness). Consider splitting this into its own section with a tiny **self-contained intro** (definitions, greedy construction, parity split) and a boxed theorem/proposition so readers can consume it independently of the cyclic-number parts. Right now it’s clear but a bit interleaved.  

# Presentation & structure tweaks (non-blocking but important)

* **Result map/table.** Add a one-page table: *Cohen Conjecture # → your theorem/prop # → status (proved/disproved).* This complements your nice bullet list and helps skimming. 
* **Explicit constants/thresholds.** Where you say “for all large (x)” or “choose (A) large,” give one admissible numerical choice (e.g., (A=10), (n\ge n_0=10^6)).
* **Reference precision.** In “Uniform tools,” replace generic [11–14] with **exact theorem numbers** (e.g., Montgomery–Vaughan BT inequality, Selberg upper bound sieve form you use for unions, fundamental lemma version/normalization). 
* **Motivation/related work.** One short paragraph contrasting cyclic-analog results vs. prime-analog literature will position your contributions better for non-specialists.

# Line-item correctness checks (quick pass)

* **Π-variation step in Conj. 9:** Your derivation to local increments (C(x+h)-C(x)\sim a(x),h/x) looks standard; just **box the auxiliary function (a(x))** and cite BGT Thm 3.7.2 explicitly (or analogous), since this is a key hinge.
* **Weighted BT over unions:** you state a version with (\sum_{q\in\mathbb P\cap U,,q\equiv1(p)}\log q\ll \text{mes}(U)/\varphi(p)) and the counting corollary (\ll \text{mes}(U)/(\varphi(p)\log z)). Please add the *exact source* (Selberg upper-bound sieve corollary) and state the requirement (U\subseteq[z,\infty)). 
* **“At most one (r)” arguments:** Where interval lengths drop below 1, explicitly note the integrality step and range of parameters (you often do; keep it consistent).
