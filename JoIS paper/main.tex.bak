\begin{abstract}
We resolve several conjectures about cyclic numbers (positive integers $n$ with $\gcd(n,\varphi(n))=1$) and settle a related problem about a sequence whose running averages are Fibonacci numbers. Specifically:
\emph{(i)} we prove an asymptotic for the number of cyclic integers between consecutive squares, including a second-order term;
\emph{(ii)} we establish a Rosser-type lower bound $c_n>e^{\gamma} n\log_3 n$ for all $n>1$;
\emph{(iii)} we prove the Ishikawa-type inequality $c_n+c_{n+1}>c_{n+2}$ for all $n>2$ (with equalities at $n=1,2$);
\emph{(iv)} we disprove a Panaitopol-type inequality by exhibiting $c_{35}=91=c_5c_7$;
\emph{(v)} we confirm the limits $c_n/G_n\to e$ and $A_n/G_n\to e/2$;
\emph{(vi)} for the lexicographically least sequence of pairwise distinct positive integers whose initial running averages are Fibonacci numbers, we determine the exact blockwise structure and give closed forms on each block.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
An integer $n\ge1$ is \emph{cyclic} if every group of order $n$ is cyclic. By Szele \cite{Szele1947}, this is equivalent to $\gcd(n,\varphi(n))=1$, where $\varphi$ is Euler's totient function. Let $C$ denote the set of cyclic numbers, let $C(x):=\#\{c\in C: c\le x\}$ be its counting function, and let $(c_n)_{n\ge1}$ be the increasing enumeration of $C$.

\begin{remark}
Two immediate consequences of Szele's criterion will be used repeatedly: (i) $2$ is the only even cyclic integer (if $n$ is even and $n>2$, then $2\mid n$ and $2\mid \varphi(n)$, so $\gcd(n,\varphi(n))\ge2$); (ii) $1$ is the only square in $C$ (if $n$ is a square $>1$, then $p\mid n$ and $p\mid \varphi(n)$ for some prime $p$, so again $\gcd(n,\varphi(n))>1$). All odd primes are cyclic since $\gcd(p,\varphi(p))=\gcd(p,p-1)=1$.
\end{remark}

Many conjectures about cyclics proposed by Cohen \cite{Cohen2025} are analogs of well-known results or conjectures for the prime numbers (sequence \seqnum{A000040}), with $C$ playing the role of $\mathbb P$. In this paper we give complete proofs or counterexamples to several of these conjectures, and we give a detailed blockwise analysis of an OEIS problem about running averages equaling Fibonacci numbers (sequence \seqnum{A248982}). Throughout, we emphasize exactly which conjectures are settled and how.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Summary of resolved conjectures.}
We resolve the following conjectures from \cite{Cohen2025} (numbers as in that paper):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Conjecture~9 (cyclics between consecutive squares): proved with a sharpened asymptotic; see Theorem~\ref{thm:squares}.
  \item Conjecture~52 (Rosser analog): proved; see Theorem~\ref{thm:rosser}.
  \item Conjecture~54 (Ishikawa analog): proved; see Theorem~\ref{thm:ishikawa}.
  \item Conjecture~59 (Panaitopol analog): disproved by the equality $c_{35}=c_5c_7=91$; see Theorem~\ref{thm:panaitopol}.
  \item Conjecture~60 (Vrba analog): proved; see Theorem~\ref{thm:vrba}.
  \item Conjecture~61 (Hassani analog): proved; see Theorem~\ref{thm:hassani}.
  \item Fried's A248982 conjecture on closed forms on the blocks where the running average is a Fibonacci number: proved in a blockwise form; see Theorem~\ref{thm:fib-blocks}.
\end{itemize}

We use the Euler--Mascheroni constant $\gamma$, and write $\log_k x$ for the $k$-fold iterated natural logarithm (so $\log_1 x = \log x$, $\log_2 x = \log\log x$, and $\log_3 x = \log\log\log x$ for $x>e^e$). A key analytic input is the asymptotic for $C(x)$ due to Erd\H{o}s and sharpened by Pollack \cite{Pollack2022}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Pollack}
 C(x) \sim \frac{e^{-\gamma} x}{\log_3 x} \quad (x\to\infty),\quad C(x) = e^{-\gamma} x\left(\frac{1}{\log_3 x} - \frac{\gamma}{\log_3^2 x} + O\!\left(\frac{1}{\log_3^3 x}\right)\right).
\end{equation}
We also use standard facts from regular variation \cite{BGT1989} and asymptotic integration \cite{deBruijn1970} as indicated.

\section{Cyclics between consecutive squares}
This section \emph{resolves Conjecture~9} of Cohen \cite{Cohen2025}. The precise asymptotic below sharpens the conjectured main term by adding the next-order correction from \eqref{eq:Pollack}.

\section{Vrba- and Hassani-type limits for cyclics}
This section \emph{resolves Conjectures~60 and~61} of Cohen \cite{Cohen2025}.
Define the geometric and arithmetic means of the first $n$ cyclics by
\[
 G_n:=\bigg(\prod_{k=1}^n c_k\bigg)^{\!1/n},\qquad A_n:=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n c_k.
\]

\section{A blockwise result for an OEIS problem on Fibonacci averages}
Let $(a_n)_{n\ge1}$ be the lexicographically least sequence of pairwise distinct positive integers such that the average of any initial segment is a Fibonacci number. Writing $S_n:=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$ and $A_n:=S_n/n$, this means that for each $n$, $A_n\in\{F_k:k\ge1\}$, where $F_1=F_2=1$ and $F_{k+2}=F_{k+1}+F_k$. This is sequence \seqnum{A248982}. Fried \cite[ยง6]{Fried2025} proposed explicit closed-form candidates for $a_n$ on parity-based intervals and noted the remaining obstacle of set disjointness. We settle a blockwise version of this conjecture by proving that, for each Fibonacci level $F_k$, the index set $I_k:=\{n\ge1:A_n=F_k\}$ is an interval of length one or two, and by giving closed forms for $a_n$ on each such block.

For $k\ge3$, define the index set $I_k:=\{n\ge1:A_n=F_k\}$ and $n_k:=\min I_k$.
